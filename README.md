What are we going to build?<br/>
We are going to build a job board website, In which we will be having:<br/>
- List a job
- Details of the Job post
- Create a job post
- Update the job
- Delete the job
- Permissions (Authorization required, only superuser and the original author can delete)
- Authentication ( Registration and Login )
- Test our Endpoints
- Test Coverage
- Webapp for Jobboard<br/>

We will be following something called Test-Driven Development in which we will be creating a unit-test for each of the components, then think then implement our feature.
